Steam Screenshot Downloader
===========================

Currently (June 29th, 2014) this is a work in progress open source project to make a small tool to download screenshots of steamcommunity.com. This project started as a feature request on reddit.com and I decided to hack something together in C#.NET. Quite a few people asked if they could see the source and I did not feel like sharing the code because I was by no means proud of what I wrote. Today, 8 months later, I decided to rewrite this project in Java using JavaFX. 

The repository is quite empty at this moment, but will contain a fully working version in the very near future.
Thank you for your interest, please come by soon!
